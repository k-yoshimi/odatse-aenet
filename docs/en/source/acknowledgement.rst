This software is based on the code developed in the master's thesis of
谷田秀哉 (Shuya Tanida), "Coupling of Data Analysis Framework 2DMAT
with Machine Learning Potentials" (2025).
In that thesis, a coupling tool between the data analysis framework 2DMAT
(now ODAT-SE) and the machine learning potential AENET was developed, as well
as a fusion tool (ElsesCalculator) integrating the model electronic structure
calculation code ELSES with the integrated simulation environment ASE.

We would like to thank 小谷岳生 (Takao Kotani) of Tottori University, who
supervised 谷田秀哉, and 星健夫 (Takeo Hoshi) of National Institute for Fusion
Science, a co-developer of ELSES and ODAT-SE.

This software was developed with the support of the Project for Advancement of
Software Usability in Materials Science (PASUMS) at the Institute for Solid
State Physics, The University of Tokyo.
